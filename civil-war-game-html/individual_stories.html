              <h3>Edward Day Cohota</h3>
              <p>Found as a half-starved stowaway on the ship named Cohota, Edward Day Cohota worked as a cabin boy before eventually coming to Gloucester, Massachusetts and being educated. In 1864, Cohota joined the 23rd Massachusetts Infantry, where he fought at the Battle of Drury’s bluff, miraculously surviving after seven shots pierced his clothes. Later, at the Battle of Cold Harbor, Cohota was shot in the head, but despite his injury, he persevered and saved the life of a heavily injured soldier, dragging him to safety before returning to the front. Cohota was a proud American but unfortunately his citizenship was denied despite his service due to the Chinese Exclusion Acts. </p>

              <h3>Hong Neok Woo</h3>
              <p>Woo was born in a small town 5 miles outside of Changchow, China. Woo made his way to America at a young age, tagging along as a cabin boy on a US Navy ship (led by the famous Commodore Matthew Perry, who had just opened up Japan to foreign trade and was travelling back to America). Woo was soon taken in by a local doctor in Lancaster, PA, where he would become heavily involved in his local church. In spite of the concerns from his friends and family, Woo enlisted and joined the 15th Pennsylvania Volunteer Militia regiment, primarily because he believed in the North’s anti-slavery ideals. Although Woo and his regiment never partook in any battles, he vividly remembers a march, in which he marched day and night under the scorching summer sun. After his enlistment, Woo would return to Lancaster for nine years before returning to his home country of China. </p>

              <h3>Christopher Wren Bunker</h3>
              <p>Christopher was born in the US and enlisted as part of the 37th Battalion, Virginia Cavalry, as soon as he turned 18. Unusually born to slave owning Siamese Southerners, Bunker participated in J.E.B. Stuart’s Famous raid on Chambersville. Bunker was injured and captured as a prisoner of war during a Union ambush on Confederate campgrounds. During his stint as a POW, Bunker slept in small barracks with hundreds of other soldiers and spent his days reading the Bible and making wood carvings. On September 9, 1864, he was hospitalized with Variola, and 6 months later in March 1865, he was released in exchange for a Union POW. After his release, Christopher returned to his Southern town and took up farming like his parents, just without the use of slave labor.

              <h3>Joseph Pierce</h3>
              <p>Originally from Canton, China, Pierce’s origins remain unclear. It is believed that he was sold into slavery as a young age and brought to the United States as a child. Pierce enlisted in the army at the age of 20 and joined the Fourteenth Connecticut Infantry regiment. He fought in many notable battles, and remained with the army until Lee’s surrender in 1865. During the battle of Gettysburg, Pierce’s bravery was on full display, as he was one of the first soldiers to volunteer to fight on the front lines and actively go out into battle. Pierce was eventually promoted to Corporal for his distinguished service, an exceptional distinction that defied the racism Pierce faced in the United States. </p>

              <h3>Antonio Dardelle</h3>
              <p>Born in Kwangtung Province, China, Dardelle’s early life is shrouded in mystery. What is known is that he was brought to Connecticut at the age of 7 by Captain David White, where he received his education at Clinton Academy. Dardelle enlisted straight out of school at the young age of 18, and joined the 27th regiment. At the battle of Fredericksburg, Dardelle participated in the charge on Marye’s heights, where he was severely injured in his right shoulder. After the war, Dardelle was honorably discharged and lived out the rest of his life in his hometown of Clinton, where he got married and has 3 daughters. In 1880, he became a naturalized US citizen, but despite his service, was denied his veterans pension due to not knowing his exact date of birth.</p>

              <h3>John/William Hang</h3>
              <p>Hang was born in Canton, China and came to the US only 5 years before enlisting in the military. Much of his life is still a mystery. Nonetheless, it is known that he enlisted to fight in the Civil War at the Brooklyn Navy Yard on July 24, 1863. In the Navy, he served as a Landsman on multiple ships including the North Carolina and Albatross. After being discharged on September 30, 1864, Hang moved to Staten Island, where he started a grocery store. Decades later in 1892, Hang would receive his US citizenship, which would be unfortunately revoked just 4 years later because of the Chinese Exclusion Act. </p>

              <p>Native to the Philippines, Baldery joined the crew of a sailing vessel before moving to Michigan where he worked as a farmhand. Balderry enlisted in the 11th Michigan infantry in December of 1863, before being sent to the western theater of the war, where he participated in some of the fiercest fighting. At the battle of Missionary Ridge, Balderry participated in an uphill charge against a dug in Confederate artillery battery, where his regiment succeeded in breaching the Confederate line. Balderry continued to fight in several more major battles until the end of the war. </p>

              <p>Brought to Mississippi from Zhejiang by missionaries. Though he was well-liked by comrades, Marshall received similar treatment as slaves while serving in Nathan Bedford Forrest's infamous cavalry unit in battles including Fort Donelson and Shiloh. He had a wide range of duties as a cavalryman including: foraging, carrying dispatches, guarding prisoners, and handling horses. </p>

              <h3>Ching Lee aka Thomas Sylvanus</h3>
              <p>Brought to the United States to become educated as a Chinese missionary, Thomas was dissatisfied in the United States and wanted to return to China. At 16 years old, following the outbreak of the war, Thomas enlisted in the 42nd New York Volunteer Regiment, and was a corporal in the Color guard. At the battle of Spotsylvania, after the rest of the guard had been killed or wounded, Thomas took up the flag, and kept it flying on the breastworks. Eventually, Thomas was captured and sent to Andersonville prison camp where he contracted a disease that ultimately led him to go blind, all in service to a country that never remembered his sacrifice.</p>
